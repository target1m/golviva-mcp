# Golviva MCP tools — reference

Generated from the server's own tool registrations (server v2.1.0). Endpoint:
`https://api.golviva.com/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, OAuth sign-in).

Every tool is read-only: `readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`, `idempotentHint: true`.
`openWorldHint: true` marks the tools that read live match data from API-Football at call time;
the rest read Golviva's own database. Every result has a one-line text summary, the same data as
`structuredContent`, and an interactive card in clients that support MCP Apps.

## `search_football` — Search Golviva
