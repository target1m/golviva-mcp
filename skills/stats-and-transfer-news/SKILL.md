# Leaderboards and the transfer wire

Full argument list:
[`../value-and-compare-players/references/tools.md`](../value-and-compare-players/references/tools.md).

## Leaderboards (`get_stat_leaders`)

- `metric`: `goals` (default), `assists`, `contributions` (goals + assists), `minutes`,
  `appearances`.
- `competition`: a code or name — leagues (`GB1`, `ES1`, `IT1`, `L1`, `FR1`, `TR1`…), cups
  (`UCL`, `UEL`, `UECL`, `FAC`…), `NT` for all national-team competitions together, or `all`
  (the default) for every competition combined. A player who moved mid-season counts once.
- `season` is the start year (2025 = 2025/26). Without it you get the latest season with data —
  say which season your answer covers.
- Leaderboards include players outside the leagues Golviva values; such a player simply has no
  valuation to show.

## Transfer news (`get_transfer_news`)

- Narrow with `query` (a player or club name) and `type`: `confirmed`, `rumors` or `all`.
- Every item carries a **reliability**. Report a rumour as a rumour ("reported", "linked with"),
  never as a done deal; only `confirmed` items are completed transfers.
- Fees are as reported. Undisclosed fees and loans stay undisclosed — don't fill the gap with a
  guess.
- The feed covers recent items. If nothing matches, say Golviva has no recent item, not that no
  transfer happened.

After a reported fee, `get_player` shows whether Golviva thinks the price is fair — see the
`value-and-compare-players` skill.
